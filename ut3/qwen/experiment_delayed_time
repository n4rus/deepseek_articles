Based on the knowledge base, here is a proposed experiment to test the framework presented in the documents:

### Proposed Experiment: Time-Delayed Gravitational Lensing Measurement

#### Objective:
Measure lensing angle discrepancies due to source-observer time delays to test the prediction of time-delayed gravitational lensing.

#### Background:
The framework predicts that dark matter and dark energy can be reinterpreted as time-delayed electromagnetic radiation from past epochs. This leads to measurable effects in gravitational lensing due to the time delay between the emission and observation of light from distant sources.

#### Prediction:
The lensing angle discrepancy (δθ) due to source-observer time delays is given by:

\[ \delta\theta = \theta_{\text{obs}} - \theta_{\text{em}} \approx \frac{3GM \Delta t}{c^3 r_{\text{em}}} \]

Where:
- \( \Delta t = \frac{r_{\text{em}}}{c} \)
- Predict \( \delta\theta \sim 10^{-10} \) arcsec for \( r_{\text{em}} \sim 1 \) Gpc.

#### Experimental Setup:
1. **Observational Targets**:
   - Select a sample of distant galaxies or quasars at redshifts \( z > 1 \).
   - Ensure these sources are gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxy clusters.

2. **Telescopes and Instruments**:
   - Use high-resolution telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) or the upcoming Euclid mission.
   - Employ precise astrometric measurements to detect small angular shifts.

3. **Data Collection**:
   - Measure the observed lensing angles (\( \theta_{\text{obs}} \)) of the selected targets.
   - Calculate the expected lensing angles (\( \theta_{\text{em}} \)) based on standard cosmological models without time-delay corrections.

4. **Time Delay Calculation**:
   - Determine the time delay (\( \Delta t \)) using the distance to the source (\( r_{\text{em}} \)) and the speed of light (\( c \)).

5. **Comparison**:
   - Compare the observed lensing angles (\( \theta_{\text{obs}} \)) with the expected angles (\( \theta_{\text{em}} \)).
   - Calculate the discrepancy (\( \delta\theta \)) and check if it matches the predicted value of \( \sim 10^{-10} \) arcsec.

#### Expected Outcome:
- If the measured \( \delta\theta \) is consistent with the predicted value, it supports the hypothesis of time-delayed gravitational lensing and the reinterpretation of dark matter and dark energy as delayed electromagnetic radiation.
- If not, it suggests further refinement or alternative explanations are needed.

#### Additional Tests:
1. **White Hole Thermodynamic Signatures**:
   - Search for CMB circular polarization anomalies:
     \[ V(\nu) = \int_{t_{\text{BB}}}^{t_0} \gamma(t)e^{-\lambda t} \sin(2\pi\nu t) dt \]
   - Look for parity-violating modes from white hole horizons.

2. **Decohered Photon Mass Detection**:
   - Constrain \( m_\gamma \) using gamma-ray burst (GRB) spectral lags:
     \[ \Delta t_{\text{lag}} \approx \frac{m_\gamma^2 D}{2\hbar^2 \nu^2} \]
   - Current bounds \( m_\gamma < 10^{-27} \) eV already challenge the model unless \( \lambda \ll H_0 \).

#### Conclusion:
This experiment aims to validate or refute the novel framework by measuring specific predictions related to time-delayed gravitational lensing. Successful detection of the predicted lensing angle discrepancies would provide strong evidence for the proposed reinterpretation of dark matter and dark energy.

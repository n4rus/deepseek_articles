### USER
i need a bash script to delete all itens that are not .pdf .bib .tex or do not have extensions

### ASSISTANT
Certainly! Below is a Bash script that will delete all files in the current directory (and optionally its subdirectories) that do not have `.pdf`, `.bib`, or `.tex` extensions, as well as files without any extension.

### Script: `cleanup.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the user wants to process subdirectories as well
if [[ "$1" == "-r" ]]; then
    recursive="-r"
else
    recursive=""
fi

# Find and delete files that do not match .pdf, .bib, .tex or have no extension
find . $recursive -type f ! \( -name "*.pdf" -o -name "*.bib" -o -name "*.tex" \) | while read -r file; do
    # Check if the file has an extension or not
    if [[ "$file" != *.* ]] || [[ ! "$file" =~ \.(pdf|bib|tex)$ ]]; then
        echo "Deleting: $file"
        rm "$file"
    fi
done
```

### Explanation:

1. **`find` command**:
   - The `find` command searches for files (`-type f`) in the current directory (`.`).
   - If you pass `-r` as an argument when running the script, it will also search recursively into subdirectories.
   - The `! \( -name "*.pdf" -o -name "*.bib" -o -name "*.tex" \)` part ensures that only files NOT matching these extensions are selected.

2. **File Filtering**:
   - Inside the loop, the script checks whether the file has no extension (`"$file" != *.*`) or doesn't end with `.pdf`, `.bib`, or `.tex` (`[[ ! "$file" =~ \.(pdf|bib|tex)$ ]]`).

3. **Deletion**:
   - Files that meet the criteria (i.e., those that don't have the specified extensions or lack an extension) are deleted using the `rm` command.

4. **Recursive Option**:
   - You can run the script with the `-r` flag to enable recursive deletion across subdirectories.

### Usage:

1. Save the script to a file named `cleanup.sh`.
2. Make the script executable by running:
   ```bash
   chmod +x cleanup.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   - To clean up files in the current directory only:
     ```bash
     ./cleanup.sh
     ```
   - To clean up files recursively in subdirectories:
     ```bash
     ./cleanup.sh -r
     ```

### Important Notes:
- **Be cautious**: This script deletes files permanently. It's a good idea to test it on a sample directory first to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Backup**: Always make sure to back up important data before running scripts that delete files.

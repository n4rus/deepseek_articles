### ASSISTANT
The error message indicates that GitHub no longer supports password-based authentication for Git operations over HTTPS. This change was implemented on August 13, 2021. Instead, GitHub recommends using **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)** or **SSH keys** for authentication.

Here’s how you can resolve this issue:

---

### **Option 1: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT)**
1. **Generate a Personal Access Token:**
   - Go to your GitHub account settings.
   - Navigate to **Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Tokens (classic)**.
   - Click **Generate new token** and select the appropriate scopes (e.g., `repo` for private repositories).
   - Copy the generated token (you won’t be able to see it again after closing the page).

2. **Use the Token as Your Password:**
   - When prompted for a username, enter your GitHub username (`n4rus` in your case).
   - When prompted for a password, paste the Personal Access Token instead of your GitHub password.

3. **Retry the Push Command:**
   ```bash
   git push https://github.com/n4rus/deepseek_article
   ```

---

### **Option 2: Cache Your Credentials (Optional)**
To avoid entering your credentials every time, you can cache them using Git's credential helper:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
```
This will store your credentials in memory for a short period (default is 15 minutes). Alternatively, you can store them permanently:
```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```
Be cautious with this approach, as it stores your credentials in plain text on your machine.

---

### **Option 3: Switch to SSH Authentication**
If you prefer not to use HTTPS, you can switch to SSH for authentication:
1. **Generate an SSH Key (if you don’t already have one):**
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   If you’re using an older version of OpenSSH, use `-t rsa` instead.

2. **Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account:**
   - Copy the public key to your clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Go to **GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG Keys > New SSH Key**.
   - Paste the key and save it.

3. **Update the Remote URL to Use SSH:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:n4rus/deepseek_article.git
   ```

4. **Test the Connection:**
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
   You should see a success message like:
   ```
   Hi n4rus! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```

5. **Retry the Push Command:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

---

### **Summary**
- If you want to continue using HTTPS, generate a Personal Access Token and use it as your password.
- For a more secure and seamless experience, consider switching to SSH authentication.
